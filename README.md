# refactored-aws-creator
Project to create full VPC deployment with VPN connector.
Just trying it out for now. We will see. The idea is to create the code that creates VPC, all the networking infrastructure, than creates VPN connect. At the end the whole thing could be deleted. Make it asynchronous, and use command pattern to "do" and "undo".
